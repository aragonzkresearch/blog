      "metadescr": "OVOTE (Offchain Voting with Onchain Trustless Execution) is a L2 design for voting using validity-proofs (zkSNARK proofs), which is similar to zkRollups. The main idea is that the votes are aggregated offchain, and proved onchain through a zkSNARK proof, resulting in constant gas costs while scaling up to thousands of voters through a single Ethereum transaction."

      "md": "ecdsa-akd.md",
      "metadescr": "Additive key derivation and ECDSA presignatures are used widely throughout the cryptocurrency space, but a security proof for the construction was missing until this point. Shoup and Groth find an attack on threshold ECDSA when using AKD and presignatures, and present a solution."

      "metadescr": "Anonymous e-voting schemes are a promising tool in the current and future digital society. We propose a simple and elegant way to add delegation capabilities to such schemes."

      "md": "oblivious-transfer.md",
      "metadescr": "Oblivious transfer (OT) is a cryptographical primitive that is fundamental for secure multiparty computation. We give a brief introduction to the Bellare-Micali OT protocol, which is particularly simple and elegant."

      "md": "lagrange.md",
      "metadescr": "Our first Maths Seminar note is about Lagrange bases in subgroups of $F_p^*$ which happen to have a simple and explicit formula. Numerous examples as well as detailed proofs of the main results are provied. We note that these particular Langrange bases have been used in the construction of the well-known PLONK zk scheme."
