### We present OVOTE: Offchain Voting with Onchain Trustless Execution

OVOTE v0.5 (Offchain Voting with Onchain Trustless Execution) is a L2 design for voting using validity-proofs (zkSNARK proofs), which is similar to zkRollups. The main idea is that the votes are aggregated offchain, and proved onchain through a zkSNARK proof, resulting in constant gas costs while scaling up to thousands of voters through a single Ethereum transaction.
